# AnyLiteryAnyThingIDo

In this repository are saved some "little programs" that I created during several courses, basically my first contact with programming.

The files that are in lua, are scripts to be executed in computer craft(yes, it is a minecraft mod).

This repository is not very useful, just so I can have something to compare when I started programming with the systems and projects I develop now.
